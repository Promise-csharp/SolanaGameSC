# Solana Game Items Smart Contract

This project implements a Solana smart contract for managing in-game items. The contract supports purchasing items, selling items, and using items to modify game attributes like health or damage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): The programming language used for Solana smart contracts.
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools): Command-line tools for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/): Framework for developing Solana programs (if applicable).

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Promise-csharp/SolanaGameSC.git
    cd SolanaGameSC
    ```

2. Install Rust and Solana CLI:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    solana --version
    ```

3. Configure Solana CLI to use the testnet (or mainnet if you're ready):

    ```sh
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
    ```

## Smart Contract Details

### Instructions

The smart contract handles two main operations:

1. **Purchase Item**: Allows a player to purchase an item by updating its owner and marking it as in use.
2. **Use Item**: Allows a player to use an item to modify in-game attributes. (For this example, the effect is simply logged.)

### Structures

- `GameInstruction`: Enum that defines the instructions that the contract can process.
- `GameItem`: Represents an in-game item with properties such as ID, owner, value, and whether it's in use.
- `GameState`: Manages a collection of items (note: not used in this simplified example).

## Building and Deploying

1. **Build the Program**:

    ```sh
    cargo build-bpf
    ```

2. **Deploy the Program**:

    ```sh
    solana program deploy target/deploy/solana_game_items.so
    ```

   After deployment, you will get a program ID. Make sure to save this ID, as you will need it to interact with the smart contract.

## Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the deployed contract, you can use the Solana CLI or write client scripts in JavaScript or Rust. Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how you might use the CLI:

1. **Send a Transaction**:

    ```sh
    solana program invoke <PROGRAM_ID> --data <INSTRUCTION_DATA> --signer <SIGNER_KEYPAIR>
    ```

2. **Example Instructions**:

    - **Purchase Item**:
      ```sh
      solana program invoke <PROGRAM_ID> --data <PURCHASE_INSTRUCTION_DATA> --signer <SIGNER_KEYPAIR>
      ```

    - **Use Item**:
      ```sh
      solana program invoke <PROGRAM_ID> --data <USE_INSTRUCTION_DATA> --signer <SIGNER_KEYPAIR>
      ```




## Batch file configuration

mkdir your_project_name
cd your_project_name
cargo init --lib

## Testing


For local testing, you can write test scripts or use the Solana test validator. Follow the [Solana testing guide](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator) for more details on setting up a local test environment.
